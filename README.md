## üß† Problem We Solved

Most existing career guidance platforms:
- Only support English,
- Consume high bandwidth,
- Don‚Äôt understand local cultures or contexts.

This project solves that by:
- Giving career suggestions in *regional languages* (like Telugu, Hindi, Tamil, etc.),
- Running even on *low-end systems* and *offline*, and
- Collecting real-world *multilingual career Q&A data* to help AI researchers and developers build inclusive tools.
